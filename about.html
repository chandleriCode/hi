            <h2>Gas</h2>
            <p>     Gas is a Mythical Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs $ 3,200,000 or R$ 2,500 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                Gas allows the user to use gaseous (including concentrated and flammable) attacks against their opponents, and will also be granted a purely cosmetic purple, gaseous aura around them. The user will also gain the ability to transform into a powerful gaseous knight, just like the quote above says.
                Gas has an extremely high AoE (Area of Effect), damage and is an extremely good fruit for combos. Being one of the best tank and anti-teamers of the game due to huge AoE, spammable abilities and overall damage (while transformed) makes it a very good fruit for grinding and fighting. A small downside is that this fruit has a meter which takes some time to fully charge so the user can transform. Its stunning abilities make it able to easily kill high level players with various powerful weapons while not being really good in traditional PvP.

                <h3>Gas Meter</h3>
                    The user passively gains gas. Additionally, the user gains gas by dealing damage to any NPC/player. In the untransformed state the user cannot lose any of their gas meter. However, in the transformed state, the user receives approximately 45% damage reduction and passively consumes gas, with consumption increasing when taking damage. While transformed, they can also gain more gas meter when dealing damage. When the meter is full, the user unlocks the ability to transform into a gaseous knight. This passive feature is very similar to the original Fury Meter.	Gas Meter
