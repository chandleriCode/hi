            <h2>Dough</h2>
            <p>Dough is a Mythical Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs $ 2,800,000 or R$ 2,400 from the Blox Fruit Dealer. Dough has incredible PvP potential and moderate grinding capabilities when awakened, having great stuns, Instinct break, and great damage on almost every move, making it simultaneously sought for in trading by other players.   It is considered to be one of the most difficult Blox Fruits to awaken as well.  
                 
                <h3>Unlocking Dough Raid</h3>
                The player must have the God's Chalice God's Chalice and Conjured Cocoa 10 Conjured Cocoas.  
                It is recommended to grind Conjured Cocoas while waiting for other things to spawn, such as Elite Pirates or God's Chalice from a chest in order to save time.  
                The player must use the materials collected above to trade for the Sweet Chalice from the Sweet Crafter located at Chocolate Land in Sea of Treats.  
                The player must talk to drip_mama (located in front of the large mirror in the center of Cake Land) after 500 enemies have been defeated at Cake Land to summon Dough King using the Sweet Chalice.  
                It is recommended to do this in a private server with a few friends, as trollers, scripters, hackers, or exploiters could spawn Cake Prince instead.  
                The player who has Sweet Chalice should be the one checking drip_mama and be the one opening the portal while other players kill Enemies, as Sweet Chalice will disappear upon death or disconnection of the player owning it which would be devastating.  
                Once defeated, Dough King will drop the Red Key (assuming the player did 10% or more of the total damage).  
                The player can use the Red Key to permanently unlock the door inside Candy Castle at Cake Land.  
                Even if the player disconnects or dies with the Red Key, they will still be able to buy Dough Raid Microchips unless they never obtained it.  
                Talk to Cake Scientist to buy a Dough Raid Microchip at the cost of f 1,000 every 2 hours, or a physical Blox Fruit that is worth at least $ 1,000,000.   Players will now be able to buy Dough Raid Microchips from Mysterious Scientist upon completing the previous steps.  
                
                Note: The player can still join Dough raids hosted by other players and awaken their fruit without doing the quest.  
                
                 
                
                <h3>Awakened-Pros</h3>
                
                Very good option for gaining bounty quickly in PvP.   Extremely high combo potential. Multiple long combos that are hard for people to escape, and hence, easy for the user to repeat.  Decent for grinding, as it is an Elemental type Blox Fruit and the skills are mostly AoE.  Extremely high stun, which makes it sometimes possible to counter the ability of the Shark V3.  Extremely versatile and works whether the user is a fruit, sword, or gun main.  All moves can damage Sea Events (including the M1 move).  All moves have AoE.  All moves break instinct.  
                [TAP] Normal Attack, Long range (can be longer when held), Decent stun.
                [Z] Missile Jab, Long range, Holding the move will increase range, explosion (AoE) and if it is in the center, the damage will increase, No end-lag.  
                [X] Pastry River, All moves (Ground and Air) gain a noticeably bigger hitbox when held .  (Air doesn't have too much of a difference), Auto-aims in air, Can be combo extended into a range of different moves, Good stun.  
                [C] Piercing Clothesline,The Donut can go on water and lava, Can grab multiple NPCs/Players making it powerful and useful when encountering teamers, While spinning, the player will gain invulnerability to players for the duration of the attack, and they will not receive damage from water or lava.   (Although from high heights users will still receive damage from water), The spin has a big AoE. 
                [V] Dough Fist Fusillade, Extremely good stun, making the possibility of escape almost nonexistent, Extremely high damage, No end-lag.  
                [F] Scorching Donut, Can go on water and lava, Can climb walls, Decent speed and damage. Speed is always maintained even if the user has low health.  
                 
                
               <h3> Tips & Tricks</h3><ul>
                <li>While in water, using [V] Restless Dough Barrage/[V] Dough Fist Fusillade on somebody will  make them stop and take damage from water.   (Unless they are using Shark V2/V3/V4).</li>  
                <li>[F] Roller Donut can be used on water if the player has the Shark race upgraded to V2 or higher.  </li>
                    <li> Falling from a great height while using [F] Scorching Donut into water can sometimes deactivate the move, unless the user is using Shark V2 or above.  </li>
                        <li> [F] Roller Donut climbs slope much faster, but it cannot climb walls.   (Not to be mistaken for [F] Scorching Donut, which can climb walls, but climbs slope slower).  </li>
                            <li>[Z] Missile Jab will have a bigger explosion when held.   Since being fully held only takes about half a second, so unless used in a combo, it's better to hold it.  </li>
                                <li>  If the user holds [X] Pastry River (ground), it becomes slightly taller and has a bigger overall look and hitbox.   It does not deal more damage.  </li>
                                    <li>  Although V2 is regarded as good for grinding, as it is an Elemental and the skills are mostly AoE, It is very difficult to get V2 and skills have high knockback.   Also, most </li>
                                        <li>  NPCs in the Second and the Third Sea have Aura, so Elemental Reflex is mostly ineffective.   It is not recommended to use this fruit to farm.  </li>
                                            <li>  It is recommended to use Angel V4's King's Rule while using [C] Piercing Clothesline, since the opponent is damaged by King's Rule at the start and the end, dealing more damage.   Using Cyborg's V3 ability can produce similar results.  </li>
                                                <li>  [F] Scorching Donut and [C] Piercing Clothesline look similar, so it is recommended to keep distance.   Note: Piercing Clothesline donut at a short distance can be Instinct dodged or just damage the donut in any way without being hit.   (Using a long-range attack or gun is recommended.  )</li>
                                                    <li>  Human's Psycho Tier 2 ability allows the player to hold down moves without their moves being interrupted/cancelled when damaged.   This is really useful as some of Dough's moves are easily cancellable by other moves and this allows the player to hold down a move like [V] Dough Fist Fusillade without getting interrupted.  </li>
                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <li>Dough is one of the fruits that got its icon remade, but still shows the same old icon in the player's inventory/hotbar (the new icon model is only visible in the shop/blox fruit dealer or a the permanent).  </li>
                    <li> Dough is the most expensive fruit to awaken, tied with Phoenix at f 18,500.   Although it can be argued Rumble is the most expensive fruit to awaken (if Pole (2nd Form) is included), at f 19,500 (of which f 5,000 is spent to get Pole (2nd Form), although it's not for the fruit, it's a sword add-on).  </li>
                        <li> All of the awakened moves are affected by Aura Colors, changing the outline in all the moves and "electricity" effects (the only other fruit in which the moves are affected by the Aura Color being Spider). </li> 
                            <li> Dough is one of the two only Blox Fruits that has two variations of a move without any kind of transformation alongside Kitsune, said moves being Dough's [X] Pastry River ground and air variations, and Kitsune's [Z] Accursed Enchantment hit and miss versions.  </li>
                                <li> There are multiple glitches with this fruit, including:</li>
                                    <li> [X] Pastry River can make the user stuck in place and unable to move until they get killed or reset, and using the move mid-air can sometimes result in the opponent getting glitched out of the map.  </li>
                                        <li> If the user is getting hit by [V] Dough Fist Fusillade and someone attacks the Dough user, they will be locked in place until death or leaving. </li> 
                                            <li>  This can also happen if the user is holding the move and then exits the game.  </li>
                                                <li> When the user uses the [Z] (unawakened/awakened) or [X] Pastry River (Air), they can see that their arm disappears but rebuilds itself with mass.  </li>
                                                    <li>  Dough unawakened [X] and [C] bear a visual resemblance to a move from an old game made by Mygame43, Elemental Battlegrounds.  </li>
                                                        <li> If the user uses Dough's [C]Piercing Clothesline while not using any Aura Colors, the effects will default to red.  </li>
                                                            <li>  If two Dough users use [C] Piercing Clothesline against each other, both of them will hit, but no one would take damage.  </li>
                                                                <li>  Dough’s [C] (awakened/unawakened) can be used as an alternative for its [F] move (awakened/unawakened), but only for four seconds.  </li>
                                                                    <li>  [V] Dough Fist Fusillade will appear with bigger hands when used with aura while without will make it appear significantly skinnier.  </li>
                                                                        <li>  Dough is the only Mythical fruit that can be awakened.  </li>
                                                                            <li> Dough is the first Mythical Elemental fruit, while the second is Gas.  </li>
                                                                                <li> Dough used to be a Natural fruit that had the Elemental Reflex passive only if the user's Instinct was turned on, but this was later removed and the fruit was entirely Elemental.  </li>
                                                                                    <li>  Awakened Dough Z's projectile is actually a small aura covered fist after being fired.</li>
